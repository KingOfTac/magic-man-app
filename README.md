# magic-man-app
Issues, roadmap &amp; readme for a MTG multiplayer application.

## Links
- [Roadmap](https://github.com/users/KingOfTac/projects/2/views/1)
- App - TBD

## Technolgies Used
1. React with native web components from [FAST](https://github.com/microsoft/fast) on the frontend.
2. .Net Core 3.1 and signalR on the backend.
3. MongoDB for data storage.
4. Auth0 for user authentication.
5. Card data sourced from scryfall's API.

## Why?
This project was built so that I could learn React and web sockets. I chose a complicated application over your typical todo starter app in order to quickly gain more real world knowledge of different technologies.

## FAQ

    <li>While spelltable is a fantastic app for playing paper magic remotely, some users with limited connectivity tend to have a negative experience.</li>
    <li>This app doesn't use webcams and instead opts for a digital game board experience, that should provide a smooth experience for users with slower connections.</li>
    <li>User's have the option to store the application's card database locally for even better performance. The entire card database is about 250MB.</li>
    <li>User's have the ability to store decklist's in their profile to play with.</li>
